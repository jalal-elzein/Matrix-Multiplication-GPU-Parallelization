# Matrix-Multiplication-GPU-Parallelization
Parallelizing Matrix Multiplication via GPU acceleration using the CUDA C library!
This is a project that I made as part of my CSC447 - Parallel Computing course at LAU.  

# What's in this repo?
File Name | Description
--- | ---
standard.cu | Standard CUDA Implementation of Matrix Multiplication
README.md | you're reading it :p 
report.md | Markdown source of my final report
sequential.cpp | Sequential Implementation of Matrix Multiplication
tiled.cu | Tiled CUDA Implementation of Matrix Multiplication

# What technologies were used?
The code is written entirely in C++ and the CUDA C library
